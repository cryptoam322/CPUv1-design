# CPUv1-design
Own self learning project attempting to make a 64 bit design
Don't expect much from this lol


Current goal is to create a spec sheet(albeit minimal)(done already) and a simulator in python
This will allow me to then use the tools in Nand2Tetris to start making the needed circuit components and compare outputs to the python simulator.
Afterwards, I'll work on refining the design and tools around it(eg the simulator).
After that(if I ever get there), potentially make a programming language and operating system?

Anyways, expect there to be some obvious issues and etc in this repository. This is after all self learning.
And python may not be the ideal language to write the cpu simulator in.
